SimpleDB backup script with node.js

Usage: 

    First, fill in settings.json with your personal settings.

    backup: node app.js --config settings.json
    restore: node app.js --config settings.json --restore

Assumptions:

    When you run with "restore" flag, the domain you set to restore to in the settings.json should *not* yet exist.  It will be created for you.

Migrate to **CouchDB**:

If you want to migrate to CouchDB you can take a backup of your SimpleDB, then:

* Fill in "restoreFrom" in settings.json which should point to a backup file created via this script
* Fill in "couchdbTarget" in settings.json which should point to an existing, but empty, couchdb database
* Run like `node app.js --config settings.json --migrate`
* The host/port for CouchDB are hardcoded for now, to localhost:5984
